This was my easiest purchase of a mattress- EVER. No walking around stores doing the mattress version of "kicking the tires". Then waiting around for the delivery which can be a 4 hour wait or an all day wait. If you're not happy with what you buy you have to check with customer service to see if they'll take it back. With TN there's none of that. I bought the size mattress I wanted- online- for much less than I've paid for almost all the mattresses I've bought in my life. I have 100 days to decide if I like it. If I don't I contact TN and make arrangements to donate the mattress to a local organization that will pick it up. I send the receipt to TN and they refund my money. BUT I like it, so with little effort on my part- cutting the plastic off the mattress when it's delivered to my door- in a size easy to move around- a box 4 feet high and 19 inches square- then as air returns to the mattress and it becomes a queen size mattress I just place it on the box spring and my job is done. Comfortable mattress at a very affordable price.
