I've been a memory foam bed person since the early 2000's.... my first "full price new mattress" out of college was a Serta memory foam bed in full size. It wasn't cheap, and it was the best I've ever had.  Since then I've moved, and have gone up in bed size now to queen. What I have now is not a Serta, unfortunately, and while it was great for a couple years, started to get a bit "too soft" in the middle, and sort of turned into a crevice in the middle.  I did something kind of unexpected with this topper and my old mattress: I flipped the old mattress on it's top-- it was foam, and firmer foam on the bottom, so starting with a firmer foundation and putting this on top essentially gave me a "new bed!"  I am very pleased that the "new bed scent" really did go away in fewer than 24 hours, it is perfectly made with no rips, tears or wrongly cut edges, and the bed cover that it came with really helps hold it in the perfect place.  This topper is the traditional "visco feel" memory foam that has more memory effect than your typical topper. It is comfortable, and throughout the night feels firmer than typical toppers. Firmer, but not uncomfortable. As soon as you settle into a new spot your warmth softens the foam and you sink in-- just a tiny bit-- to comfort.  When I buy a new mattress again in the future it probably will be a Serta again. Until then, this went a long way to making my rest a lot more restful, and with minimal effort on my part.
