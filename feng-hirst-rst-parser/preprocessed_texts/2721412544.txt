We are very happy with our new 10-inch Tuft & Needle mattress!!  About 10 years ago, we ventured forth to a well-known mattress store and bought a very expensive pillow top mattress and box spring set from a very convincing and fast-talking sales person. After 1 night of sleeping on it we hated it. After 1 month we hated it. And so on, and after 10 years we still hated it. The pillow top had body imprints in it almost from the get go, and guess what? You can't flip or turn a pillow top mattress. A night didn't go by when we didn't awake with some odd ache or pain. But, we spent so much money on the mattress that we felt we had to hang on to it as punishment for our poor judgment when we purchased it.  Last month, we heard an advertisement for Tuft & Needle during a podcast of MarketPlace. We looked at Tuft & Needle's website, we read online reviews, and then we decided the price was very reasonable and the 30-day trial period would give us a chance to try the mattress out.  It arrived as scheduled, in a large box. We took it out of the plastic and it inflated immediately. It does have some smell to it, but if you leave it out and uncovered for a few days, it seems to dissipate.  If you are worried about how to get rid of your old mattress, I simply looked online and found a charitable organization that would take it. There is also an organization called "greenbedrecycling.com" that will pick up and recycle your mattress for a small fee, so check to see if they have a recycling program in your town.  We have slept on the Tuft & Needle mattress for over 2 weeks and so far, so good. It is nice and firm, we don't feel any mattress movement when one of us turns during the night. We are sleeping so much more comfortably than we have for the past 10 years! Go ahead and purchase a Tuft & Needle mattress, you will love it.
