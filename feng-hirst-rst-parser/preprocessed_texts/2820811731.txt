I love my new Serta Mattress! I come from another country where Serta mattresses are imported and compete really well with the good quality national brands. This is how I know about Serta. Being in the United States and with the idea to buy a good mattress, I did not have doubt to choose one Serta. I have always liked the innersprings mattresses so I found Serta combines them with memory foam in some of the mattresses (hybrid) plus the gel memory foam. Serta means to me Quality and Comfort. Buy a Serta mattress is to have invested in my physical, mental and emotional health because if I can sleep deeply and rest well, I will wake up recharged, ready to begin the day full of energy. I was sleeping on an old mattress and I had back pain in my lower area, besides to sweat during the night even in winter. With my new mattress (Serta) it is past history. If your are planning to buy a mattress, I really recomend you to buy a Serta Mattress. I am happy and in love with my Serta Mattress!
