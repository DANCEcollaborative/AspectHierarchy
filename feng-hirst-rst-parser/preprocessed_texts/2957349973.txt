I am very pleased with this Casper Mattress topper as it truly gives my old mattress a new level of comfort. My mattress is a pillow top style but over the years the top layer has flattened and lost it's buoyancy. This topper by Casper has transformed my bed into a place where I'm getting a great night's sleep on now one of the best beds I've slept in! I'll start with it's design which is different then other toppers I've looked into. It's enclosed in a really nice zippered case that has material on the bottom that helps it stay in place and prevent it from moving around off the mattress. The upper material is substantial and a lovely grey color with a quality zipper. Set up was easy, just unroll and you're ready to go. I was able to fit my regular deep corner sheets and cotton mattress pad over everything once the Casper was in place. I'm not an expert on foam but apparently Casper is. Whatever technology Casper uses in their foam filling surely rises to the occasion. I didn't feel any extra heat from the topper and found I slept more soundly with less tossing and turning. My body felt cradled without that sinking in feeling. It also seems to be keeping it's shape after a good night's sleep. The only reason I'm taking off one star is because there is a ridge on one side of the topper and I tried to flatten it out with my sheets. I think it may have been a slight defect in which the inside foam was cut slightly larger then the case so it's buckled. Also, there is a slight odor but that is dissipating with time and almost all gone. Still, this Casper Mattress topper is one that I can and will recommend to anyone who wants a more comfortable and restful night's sleep. I've posted some photos and hope they along with my experience helps you out a bit with your decision. Thank you.
