I have slept on many mattresses in my life, spring and memory foam. I spent nearly a month looking at memory foam mattresses as they are not all the same. What I liked about this one is it had 3 inches of memory foam and multi layers of comfort and support foam. When I looked at other similar priced ones they only had 2 inches of memory foam, so this grabbed me right away at 3 inches. I would say that this is much nicer to sleep on than an Endy or Casper, considering the price point you can't go wrong. I'm not a light weight person, so getting the 10 inch he mattress was perfect and supports me easily. I look forward to going to bed now that I have a mattress that is so comfortable! When I opened the bag the bed inflated very quickly, all of the mattress was level and flat with no dips or bends at the sides and no gross smell like you get with a lot of these kinds of mattresses. It also allows my dog to jump on and off the bed at night to not wake me. The best thing is it doesn't sleep hot, so if you get warm during the night this mattress is not going to make you warmer. The cover on the mattress is plush and in the box you get a thank you card from the company, you also get some none marked cards to give people for birthdays or holiday occasions which is a nice touch. I really believe this mattress was far beyond my expectations and anyone doing their research can stop here, believe me I did plenty before getting this one. The only down side is its shipped by Purolator so do not expect it to be getting there on time, I had quite the argument with them when they said they misplaced a mattress..... A mattress. The manager soon made sure it was found and put on the next truck but if I hadn't caused quite the stink I'd probably still be waiting.
